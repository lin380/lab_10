## Preparation

- Read/ annotate: [Recipe \#10](https://lin380.github.io/tadr/articles/recipe_10.html). You can refer back to this document to help you at any point during this lab activity.
- Note: do your best to employ what you've learned and use other existing resources (R documentation, web searches, etc.).

## Objectives

- Gain experience working with coding strategies to prepare, feature engineer, train and test a predictive model, and evaluate results from a predictive data analysis.
- Practice transforming datasets into new object formats and visualizing relationships
- Implement organizational strategies for organizing and reporting results in a reproducible fashion.

## Instructions

In this lab we will be creating a predictive model for author detection. Specifically we will try to correctly predict the author of the once [disputed Federalist papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers). 

This lab is different than other labs, however, in that the code has been provided in the file `lab_10.Rmd`. You task will be to add the relevant prose to describe the steps as if it were part of your research project.

### Tasks

1. Change the `author: "<Your Name Here>"` line in the front matter to reflect your name.

2. Add descriptive prose to the `lab.Rmd` script to describe each of the code chunks that implement coding steps for producing this analysis and their output results. 

3. As always, provide a self-assessment of your progress in this lab.

Some questions to consider: 

  - What did you learn?
  - What was most/ least challenging?
  - What resources did you consult? 
  - What more would you like to know about?

## Submission

1. To prepare your lab report for submission on Canvas you will need to Knit your R Markdown document to PDF or Word.
2. Download this file to your computer.
3. Go to the Canvas submission page for Lab #10 and submit your PDF/Word document as a 'File Upload'. Add any comments you would like to pass on to me about the lab in the 'Comments...' box in Canvas.
